# Copilot CLI Telegram Bridge

A GitHub Copilot CLI extension that bridges Telegram messages bidirectionally with a CLI session -- send messages from Telegram, get agent responses back.

## Prerequisites

- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli) installed and working
- Extensions enabled (experimental feature -- run `/experimental on`)
- A Telegram account
- Node.js 18+ (the extension uses the built-in `fetch` API)

## Install

### Plugin install (recommended)

1. In Copilot CLI, run:
   ```
   /plugin install examon/copilot-cli-telegram-bridge
   ```
2. Restart Copilot CLI
3. Run the install skill to copy the extension into place:
   ```
   /copilot-cli-telegram-bridge:telegram-install
   ```
4. Restart Copilot CLI again (the extension loads on startup)

### Manual install

1. Clone the repo and copy the extension file:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/examon/copilot-cli-telegram-bridge.git
   mkdir -p ~/.copilot/extensions/copilot-cli-telegram-bridge
   cp copilot-cli-telegram-bridge/extension.mjs ~/.copilot/extensions/copilot-cli-telegram-bridge/
   ```
2. Restart Copilot CLI

## Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Choose a display name and a username (must end in `bot`)
4. BotFather replies with a token like `123456789:ABCdefGHI...` -- copy it

## Setup and Connect

1. Register the bot in Copilot CLI:
   ```
   /telegram setup mybot
   ```
2. Paste the bot token when prompted -- the extension validates it against the Telegram API
3. Connect to the bot:
   ```
   /telegram connect mybot
   ```
4. Open Telegram and send any message to your bot
5. The bot replies asking you to check the Copilot CLI terminal for a pairing code
6. Type the 6-character pairing code back to the bot in Telegram (case-insensitive, expires after 5 minutes)
7. Done -- messages now flow both ways between Telegram and your CLI session

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/telegram setup <name>` | Register a new bot with a local alias |
| `/telegram connect <name>` | Connect this session to the named bot |
| `/telegram connect` | List all registered bots with their status |
| `/telegram disconnect` | Disconnect from the current bot |
| `/telegram status` | Show all bots, availability, and paired users |
| `/telegram remove <name>` | Remove a bot from the registry |
| `/telegram lock` | Lock pairing (no new users can pair) |
| `/telegram unlock` | Unlock pairing (allow new users to pair) |

## Security

After the first user pairs, pairing is **automatically locked** — no other Telegram user can initiate pairing unless you explicitly run `/telegram unlock`. This makes single-user setups secure by default.

Already-paired users are unaffected by the lock and are recognized immediately across devices and session restarts.

Bot tokens are stored **in plain text** in `bots.json` (with restricted file permissions -- owner read/write only). Anyone with read access to that file can control your bot. Keep this in mind:

- Do not commit `bots.json` to version control
- Do not share or back up the extension directory without removing `bots.json` first
- If a token is compromised, revoke it immediately via @BotFather (`/revoke`) and register a new one with `/telegram setup`

## Multiple Bots

You can register as many bots as you want with `/telegram setup`. Each Copilot CLI session connects to one bot at a time, but multiple sessions can run different bots simultaneously.

If a new session connects to a bot that another session already holds, the new session takes over and the old one releases gracefully.

Access control is shared -- pairing with any bot grants access to all bots managed by this extension.

## Troubleshooting

- **Extension not loading** -- make sure you enabled the EXTENSIONS feature flag (`/experimental` in the CLI). Then verify the file exists at `~/.copilot/extensions/copilot-cli-telegram-bridge/extension.mjs`
- **Bot not responding** -- check that the token is valid. Try `/telegram disconnect` then `/telegram connect` again
- **Pairing code expired** -- codes expire after 5 minutes. Send a new message to the bot to get a fresh one
- **"Another session has this bot"** -- the bot is locked by another CLI session. Connecting again takes it over

## Uninstall

1. Disconnect if connected: `/telegram disconnect`
2. Remove the extension:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.copilot/extensions/copilot-cli-telegram-bridge
   ```
3. If installed via plugin:
   ```
   /plugin uninstall copilot-cli-telegram-bridge
   ```
